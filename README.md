# Realtime Multiple Object Detection

Object detection is the process of finding and recognizing real-world object instances. It is a computer vision technique in which a software system can detect object from a image caputured realtime or using live camera.
In our model we used the deep learning algorithms.
Compared to traditional cv techniques deep learning enables to achieve greater accuracy in tasks such as image classfication and object detection
